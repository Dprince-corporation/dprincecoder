                    <h3>What Inspired Me</h3>
                    <p>When I owned my first laptop ( HP 255 Windows 10), when i boot up the laptop i was so faccinated about those dots (..) that keep circling, and i am like wow. Then i keep asking myself, whats the whole thing that is making this circle continously. So i started asking questions, i started Googling stuff, answers till i realize is the work of programming (AKA code).</p>

                    <h3>My Journey To Tech</h3>
                    <p>When i found answers related to animation and dots circling, then one day i asked myself, is programming hard, can i also give computer instructions then she obeys me. Then i started Googling how to be a programmer, firstly i landed on ( Stack Overflow ) website, then i took a little course there like a month, but believe me am not good at just read reading plain text, gosh i got tired, and moved. then i moved to Youtube, where i got my first (Python course ) at (Codecademy ) channel, then i tried the course for 2 weeks, it was awesome gave me clear insight of loops and state, but gosh a 1 month old me, i needed to visualize and see what am doing, so i moved. Then stumbled on my mentor (Dev Ed) channel, where i took (Html and Css course) for 5 month, then later to (Javascript course) for additional 10 months.</p>

                    <h3>My Off Duty</h3>
                    <p>During my days of coding, i realized that life isn't just about coding. So i need to make sure that i also have time for (Friends, Family, Relationship and loved ones). But still i (skate) to enhance my body system and my mental health as well. I also enjoy (Hoobies ) like (Mountain) exploration and (swimming ) as well, i believe all this thing is what complete my human self state.</p>
